helix.ts is the TypeScript implementation of [helix](https://github.com/nunchistudio/helix),
for consuming public types on the front-end exposed by helix-powered services.

By using helix, engineers have the power to transparently leverage end-to-end
observability and event propagation across services and integrations.
